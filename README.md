# Organizer

Organizer is a ruby gem that allows you to perform different actions like: filtering, ordering and default or custom operations over denormalized data, in order to produce a new data structure with the result.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "organizer"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install organizer
```

## Organizer Definition

First, you need to define an organizer like this:

```ruby
Organizer.define("my_organizer") do
  # definition methods
end
```

Inside define's method block, you can pass:

### A Collection

This method takes a block containing a denormalized collection. The block's content will be executed later. So, you can pass anything that produces a collection.

```ruby
Organizer.define("my_organizer") do
  collection do
    [
      { attr1: 4, attr2: "Hi"},
      { attr1: 6, attr2: "Ciao" },
      { attr1: 84, attr2: "Hola" }
    ]
  end
end
```

```ruby
Organizer.define("my_organizer") do
  collection do
    SampleClass.get_collection
  end
end
```

## Usage

After define a new Organizer, you can use it like this:

```ruby
organizer = MyOrganizer.new
```
